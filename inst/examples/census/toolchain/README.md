# Census data analysis

These files provide context for analyzing the census data in R with the tidyverse, R Markdown, and Shiny. The files include:

1. [Exporatory data analysis](http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/357/01_census_EDA.nb.html) using dplyr, ggplot2, and plotly.
2. [Predictive models](http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/356/02_census_models.nb.html) using logistic regression and elastic net. These models predict the likelihood of census responders earning an anual income of over $50k in 1994.
3. [Flex dashboard](http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/content/355/#section-predictors) for profiling what type of census resonders were most likely to earn more than $50k.
4. Calculator for making individual predictions based on the model.
5. [Shiny app](http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/connect/#/apps/354/access) for building new models with custom inputs (in progress).
