# Census data analysis

These files provide context for analyzing the census data in R with the tidyverse, R Markdown, and Shiny. The files include:

1. Exporatory data analysis using dplyr, ggplot2, and plotly.
2. Predictive models using logistic regression and elastic net. These models predict the likelihood of census responders earning an anual income of over $50k in 1994.
3. A flex dashboard for profiling what type of census resonders were most likely to earn more than $50k.
4. A calculator for making individual predictions based on the model.
5. A Shiny app for building new models with custom inputs.
